\paragraph{Query language (DASQL) and its execution}

The queries are formed specifying the entity the user is interested
in (e.g. dataset, file, etc) and providing selection criteria (e.g.
attribute=value, attribute \emph{between} {[}v1, v2{]}). The results
could be later 'piped' for further filtering, sorting or aggregation
(min, max, avg, sum, count, median), e.g.:
