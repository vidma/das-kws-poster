\begin{document}
\begin{itemize}
\item uses simple structured queries 
\item integrated access to proprietary data-sources 

\begin{itemize}
\item process the query \& send requests to services 
\item eliminates inconsistencies in entity naming, data formats(XML, JSON)
\item combining the results
\end{itemize}
\item uses lightweight service mappings

\begin{itemize}
\item minimal effort in defining services
\item complete services structure is figured out in runtime
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Query language and Execution flow}

The queries are formed specifying the entity the user is interested
in (e.g. dataset, file, etc) and providing filtering criteria (e.g.
attribute=value, attribute \emph{between} {[}v1, v2{]}). The results
could be later 'piped' for further filtering, sorting or aggregation
(min, max, avg, sum, count, median), e.g.:
